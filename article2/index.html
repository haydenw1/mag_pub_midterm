      <p class="element drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap">Professor</span> Robert Eller has taught at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) since 2011. Currently he teaches classes in gravure and flexography and digital print processes; however, before coming to RIT he was an Executive at ExxonMobil for 30 years. He was responsible for the partnership between ExxonMobil and Esko, a software company specializing in reprographics. <span class="bold">This software would become the industry standard for reprographics for flexography.</span></p>

      <p><span class="in-text-title">Kristian Bond-Davis</span>, a third year Media Arts and Technology student, recently interviewed Professor Eller about the Esko software and how this software has revolutionized the flexographic printing industry.</p>

      <p class="text-title">CONCEPTS OF ESKO SOFTWARE</p>
      <p>Reprographics involves optimizing a design file for printability as well as optimizing workflow. Repro then transforms that same design file into a plate ready file. These processes are designed with efficiency in mind.</p>

      <p>Esko Software Suite is designed to be both efficient and cost effective, allowing for color calibration and realistic proofing of print objects.<span class="bold"> For example, with Esko a flat InDesign file of a shrink-label for a bottle can be previewed in the Esko Studio program as a 3D label shrunk to fit a bottle.</span></p>

      <p class="text-title">WHY COMPANIES USE ESKO FOR PROOFING</p>
      <p>The Esko Software Suite is integrated into Adobe Creative Suites, allowing files made in Adobe software to be previewed in Esko. Additionally, there are three major reasons why Esko software appeals to companies:</p>

        <li>The ability to find and fix issues with design files</li>
