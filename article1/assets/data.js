This was my first exposure to the world of print. When I toured RIT I was initially interested in the co-op program. I was also interested in other majors such as Graphic Design and Industrial Design.",

      "I would describe Media Arts and Technology as the transformation of content between web and print across multiple media. It’s important to understand the printing process when you’re designing for print. Certain constraints restrict how the designs are created and viewed, especially in print publications such as magazines and books. We receive the toolset and training to help businesses publish their content to different formats including the web.",
      "Advertising and Public Relations has a strong connection with our major. Most students are taking Advertising and Public Relations as either a minor or immersion. It helps build our communication skills and connects with the idea of publishing to different platforms so that we can reach viewers."

The classes have been informative and relevant and I’ve been building up work experience at the SMS Labs and at Reporter Magazine as the Production Manager. Classes and work keep me occupied throughout the week, however I also enjoy extracurricular activities such as Concert Band, racquetball, and ultimate frisbee."

It wasn’t until I started taking classes as a MAAT major and finding myself excel in them did I start to feel confident in the skills I was creating.  My experience at RIT makes me excited for my future.  I want to see how else I can expand upon my abilities and bring what I’ve learned in the classroom out into the world."

I think that Media Art's and Technology has given me a good amount of freedom in choosing classes and class times which will work best for me.

I love the facilities RIT has at the disposal of its students, especially the gym area and pool."
